# Multi Sensor Data Fusion for Floor Classification
### This is our website for our research focuses on creating a robust terrain classification system for autonomous robots by integrating data from both camera and LiDAR sensors. Leveraging decision-level fusion techniques, we combine the strengths of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for visual data and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for distance measurements. This approach ensures accurate and reliable terrain classification under varying lighting conditions, making the system adaptable to different robot designs. By addressing the limitations of individual sensor modalities and enhancing performance through data fusion, our research contributes to advancing the field of autonomous navigation and sensor fusion technology.
